# hello-world
This repository is for the CIS129 "Brainstorm 2" assignment.

My name is Christian. Although, technically, I have sophmore credits, CIS129 is my first "computer science" course. I have a little
bit of software developing experience, albeit completely self taught in the form of books and youtube videos.
